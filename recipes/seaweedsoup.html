        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This page demonstrates how to make a simple seaweed soup. This is how I and my family usually make in Vietnam. </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 pack Dried seaweed </li>
            <li>Ground pork (optional, at least a small handfull)</li>
            <li>Dried shrimp (a small handfull)</li>
            <li>Green onions, optional</li>
            <li>1/4 Onions or 1 shallot and 3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>>
            <li>1 tbsp neutral oil</li>
            <li>Seasonings</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Sometimes you should wash the dried seaweed, but I usually skip this step, lol </li>
            <li>Soak dried shrimp in warm water for at least 10 minutes, discard the water when use</li>
            <li>Season ground pork with cracked pepper, green onion heads, MSG, and a little bit of salt </li>
            <li>Heat a pot on medium heat, then add neutral cooking oil </li>
            <li>When the oil is hot, add minced garlic and onions, stir fry until aromatic</li>
            <li>Add the ground pork and soaked dried shrimp, cook until the pork is almost done </li>
            <li>Add water, as much as you like, some sugar, and turn the heat to high and cook until the water boils</li>
            <li>Add seaweed </li>
            <li>Turn off the heat when the water boils again</li>
            <li>Add a little bit of fish sauce, adjust seasonings to taste </li>
            <li>Top it off with some green onions, cilantros and cracked pepper</li>
        </ol>
