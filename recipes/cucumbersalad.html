            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This simple recipe only requires a few ingredients that you may already have on hand, and it is quick to make for a filling breakfast, lunch, or snack!</p>
            
            <p>For anyone who doesn't like dill like I do, you can omit it. In addition, I usually add some sour cream and/or cream cheese to make it creamier. You can also add a can of <em>drained</em> tuna or salmon or boiled eggs to add some more proteins! </p>
