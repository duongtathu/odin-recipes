        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Chive soup is one of my favorite soups! I don't know why, but when I'm asked what's my favorite soup, I think of 
            this! The ingredients are simple and you can omit ground pork or dried shrimp (one of either, not both). Tofu is 
            also optional. This dish can be vegan, but I have tried many ways in the past and they weren't good, so I would stick
            with adding some pork and/or shirmps to elevate the broth.
