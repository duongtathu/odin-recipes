        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>I don't actually know how to make the traditional pho recipe with beef and everything... I do know a 
            quick way to make beef pho, but I have never actually done it. Chicken pho is easy and fast, with the 
            help of the packaged pho spice, chicken pho is only an hour and a half away! </p>

            <p>This recipe includes the ingredients and instructions to make the most <em>basic</em> chicken pho. <em>lol</em> </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Chicken (whole or any part works, better if the part has meat)</li>
                <li>Pho spices package (..idk, look for it at an Asian store or sth)</li>
                <li>Pho rice noodles</li>
                <li>1 Onion</li>
                <li>Green onions</li>
                <li>Herbs for toppings (optional-ish)</li>
                <li>More spices (salt, pepper, fish sauce, MSG, siracha, hoisin sauce)</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Grill or bake the onion and ginger in a grill, a pan, or the oven until the outer edge is a bit burnt</li>
                <li>Clean and boil the chicken with the onion, ginger, spices and a tbsp of salt. You can choose to cut it into pieces before or afte cookin, it's up to you</li>
                <li>When the water comes to a rolling boil, reduce heat and let the pot cook on medium-low heat for 45 minutes to an hour (until the chicken is cooked through)</li>
                <li><p>While the pot simmering, remove the onion, ginger, and spices. <em>I usually shove the onion and ginger in the cloth bag with all the spices, so I don't remove the spices until the dish is 
                    finished just to get all the flavor in there</em></p>
                    <p>At this point, you can remove the chicken and separate the meat from the bones. Keep the meat aside, and throw the bones back into the pot </p></li>
                <li>Meanwhile, prepare the noodles according to instructions on its packaging, and prepare the vegetables and herbs as well</li>
                <li>While the pot is cooking on medium-low heat, remove the onion, ginger, and spices. <em>I usually shove the onion and ginger in the cloth bag with all the spices, so I don't remove the spices until the dish is 
                    finished just to get all the flavor in there
                </em>When the broth is almost done, taste test, add fish sauce, MSG, sugar, and adjust taste to your liking </li>
                <li>When the broth is done cooking, assemble the noodles, broth, chicken, and vegetables toppings such as bean sprouts (washed and dried), cilantro, Thai basil, chilli peppers, lime or lemon juice, siracha and hoisin sauce</li>
