        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I like my coffee with a lot of milk, and I don't like bitter coffee. I don't suggest Cafe Du Mont ground coffee for this, 
            because I find it too bitter, and I much prefer the Trung Nguyen ground coffee in the reddish/magenta color metal can. 
        </p>
            
        <p>This recipe requires a fin... but I guess a normal coffee maker works. This page demonstrates a basic way to make Vietnamese 
            drip coffee... so I guess, if you don't have a fin, it wouldn't be "drip coffee", but who cares. 
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Trung Nguyen Ground Coffee <em>(... or any ground coffee)</em></li>
            <li>Condensed milk (I love the Longevity Brand, but <em>holly hell</em> it's expensive but any brand works)</li>
        </ul> 

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a glass or ceramic cup, add about 3 tbsp of condensed milk, or the amount of your choice </li>
            <li>Place the fin on top of the cup. Remove the lid and the inner stamper, add 2-3 tsp of ground coffee into the fin, the plate with holes should go to the bottom of the holder </li>
            <li>Make sure the surface of the ground coffee inside is even, then stamp the stamper on top, press gently, just enough for it to sit on top of the coffee ground  </li>
            <li>Pour about 10ml of hot water in the chamber, close the lid and wait for a few seconds to let the coffee absorb the water </li>
            <li>Pour about 50-70ml or more hot water in the chamber, close the lid, and wait </li> 
            <li>When the coffee is done dripping, stir to enjoy hot, add crushed ice to enjoy cold, or add more milk and ice to make it a Bac Xiu </li>
        </ol>
