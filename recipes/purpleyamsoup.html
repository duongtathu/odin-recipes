        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This recipe gives instructions on how to make a simple grated purple yam soup. </p>
            
        <p>This soup is one of my favorites! It's different from most Vietnamese soup because it has a thicker texture. 
            However, the soup can be thin and more liquidy if you add more water, it's yummy either way. 
        </p>
