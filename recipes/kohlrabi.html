        <h3>Description</h3> 
        <p>Stir-fried Kohlrabi is one of my favorite side dish, it's just a perfect crunchy and savory taste that I really enjoy. No one could make it as good as my grandmother's. Later, I found out that the secret ingredient is just... more sugar. I still make this dish from time to time, and sometimes, I shed a tear or two eating this because it reminds me of her. </p>

        <p>In addition to kohlrabi, this dish includes carrots, garlic and green onions. Carrots are optional. Actually, you can customize this dish by adding some shrimps, ground pork, or eggs for some proteins, the meat will surely elevate the dish to the next level. However, this dish can also be just as simple as stir-frying garlic with kohlrabi and some spices. </p>
