        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a simple recipe with many different variations in marinating. It's better with pork shoulders, but I usually 
            buy pork loin or tenderloin from Walmart. This recipe includes ingredients and instructions on how to make a simple 
            pan-fried porkchops. 
        </p>
        <p>This dish pairs well with rice, fresh vegatbles, and Vietnamese simple pickled radish and carrots and an <em>optional</em> egg. 
            In addition, a simple bowl of bone broth soup helps complete the meal. </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>I have done this so many times that I don't remember or sure the exact measurement... so good luck!</p>
