        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>To be honest, I'm not crazy for matcha lattes. I like the ones I had in Vietnam and Starbucks a lot, 
                but whenever I tried to make the drink myself <em>(using cheap matcha powders of cources)</em>, I 
                don't like them as much. UNTIL RECENTLY, my parents sent me the cheap matcha powders from Vietnam, 
                <em>ah, yes!</em> The similar cheap shit that I used to buy when I was in middle school/high school in the 
                country, it smells much nicer, and taste so much better: more matcha-y taste, less bitter, and bright 
                green color! Why? Because it has only 80% matcha powder, the rest includes matcha essence and artifical 
                flavorings, which is great! I'm not against essence and artificial flavorings as long as they are not 
                harmful to people's health. In fact, I appreciate artificial food flavorings because it's science and 
                part of human's achievement and discoveries in chemistry, biology and whatever food science thing! It 
                can help make food cheaper and enhance the flavor and experience of users. Therefore, as long as it is 
                safe, I don't buy into the fear mongerings but I buy my beloved 80% cheap ass Vietnamese matcha powders.

        <p>This recipe works for iced and hot matcha lattes. I usually drink it iced, so if you want to make a hot matcha latte, 
            just add more milk or water. Enjoy! 
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1-2 tsp Matcha powder (of your choice)</li>
            <li>Sugar or honey</li>
            <li>Vanilla extract (Optional)</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
        </ul> 

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the matcha powder with some hot water, just enough water to mix the matcha in (about 50ml or less). 
                You can use a milk frother or a bottle to mix it well </li>
            <li>While the matcha is hot, add vanilla extract and sweetner of your choice. If you use honey, I suggest adding it 
                when the matcha cools down a bit more to prevent a weird after taste (but this kind of depends on the 
                honey as well) </li>
            <li>Add ice. Again, if you make an iced drink, the little amount of matcha helps make the drink cold, and not 
                room temperature, and the ice don't melt as fast 
            </li>
            <li>Pour in milk, I like a lot of milk, so I probably pour in about a cup or more </li> 
        </ol>
