        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I didn't appreciate Banh Xeo until after high school, now I eat it pretty regularly. I associate 
            Banh Xeo with the late afternoons, early evenings when I went on a 15-12 minutes moped ride with my 
            mom to a faraway Banh Xeo restaurant with her coworkers and my best friend. It was always fun 
            back then when my world was stable, and happy.
        </p> 
        <p>This Vietnamese crepe, like many Vietnamese dishes has a lot of vegetables. It is similar to any basic 
            savory crepe, but with many fresh herbs and vegetables. However, I don't include mung bean filling here 
            because I don't know how to make it, and I usually just make a quick and simpe version of this recipe... 
            as demonstrated below.
