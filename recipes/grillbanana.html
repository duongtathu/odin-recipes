        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This page shows you how to make a simple pan-fried banana rolls. </p>
       
        <p>I stumbled upon this dessert on the internet... I don't remember from whom, but this is 
            quite a popular recipe because of its simple ingredients. I think this dessert is from 
            Thailand... but don't quote me on this. Since I don't like cinnamon, so I omit it, haha. 
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 banana (Thai or normal)</li>
            <li>Rice papers</li>
            <li>Condensed milk</li>
        </ul> 

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut banana into slices or strips </li>
            <li>Wet or dampened a piece of rice paper, and arrange the banana pieces in the middle of the paper. 
                You don't have to use all of the banana, just enough so that you can roll it into a small square pancake or pillow 
            </li>
            <li>Wrap the banana pieces in the rice paper</li>
            <li>Heat a pan, add oil if you like then when the pan and oil are hot, pan fry the banana and flip when neccessary </li>
            <li>Turn off the heat when the banana pillow is golden brown on both sides </li>
            <li>Drizzle some condensed milk on top of the finished banana rolls </li>
        </ol>
