        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This recipe demonstrates the steps and ingredients of a basic yogurt drink. The recipe is highly customizable! 
            You can mix in fruits, fruit juices, syrups, club soda and more to customize it, the possibilities are endless! 
        </p>
            
        <p>My dad made me different kinds of drinks or desserts for me and my brother in the evening when we were studying 
            in our shared room. One of the common drinks was this yogurt drink. He usually add strawberry pieces or mix coconut 
            pulps in it. If I were at home right now, I bet he would still make me, my brother, and my mom drinks every day. 
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>Again, this recipe is highly customizable, so adjust to your taste. You can choose your yogurt, plain, Greek, strawberry flavored, sweetened, etc, 
            just remember to adjust the sugar level if you choose sweet yogurts (even consider adding less condensed milk), Same with milk, you can add strawberry 
            milk, plain milk, or whatever. The lemon/lime juice is there to add more acidity, you can try mixing with other citrus juices... I haven't try sweet 
            juices like watermelon juice though.
