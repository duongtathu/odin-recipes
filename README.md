This website project is an exercise from The Odin Project. 

Description: The website consists of a main page with a list of recipes. Each recipes is linked to another web page with ingredients and instructions. 

Skills: 
- Basic HTML5 coding (boilerplate setup, links and images, etc.)
- Git and Github 

Reflection (for when the project is finished): 
It was easy overall, the only small struggle I had was with the VS Code auto-code-completion. I tried turning things off in the settings but it didn't work, so I'll try to look for a solution later. 
In the end, the project was fun, so I decided to make some more recipes... I kind of regret this a little because I added too many, so now my right hand hurts a bit from typing, haha. In addition, here are some things I've learned since doing this project: 
- Embed a Youtube video. I wanted to embed a video so I looked up a way to do it, it wasn't as hard as I thought, but I hope I didn't make my website insecure or something. 
- Configure git to use nano to write longer commit comments with blank lines!

I'm looking foward to my next improvement!
